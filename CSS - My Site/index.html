          <h3>Python Programming</h3>
          <p>
              I started learning how to code in python in 2022 because I developed passion for DevOp
              Engineering and Data Science. Scripting is an essential part of DevOps and statistical calculation,
              data manipulation,machine learning are key parts of Data Science. Python is one of the best languages used
              in these areas and that is why I decided to learn it. Currently, I am taking a python course by Angela Yu
              and I can say that I am an intermediate python developer.

          <h3>API Utilization</h3>
          <p>
              I possess relevant skill and experience in using different APIs. During my learning and personal development,
              I have completed several projects which involved the use of and integration of several APIs. One of the
              projects that I completed was a flight search application. This is a CLI application that integrates several
              APIs: one API is used to add customer details to  a Google sheet. Then we use a flight search API to search
              for cheap flights to different locations specified. Thereafter, each customer is notified of cheap flights
              to the specified destination by mail or sms.
